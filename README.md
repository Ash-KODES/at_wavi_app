### Now for a little internet optimism

# @‎wavi

Think of @‎wavi as a public space for your business, your projects, or
yourself. Provide as little or as much information as you want on your
profile, which will be made available to the public on our directory
(http://wavi.ng). You can opt to publish contact information, location,
media, social media links, even gamer tags. You have total control over
what other people see about you.

## Who is this for?

This repo contains the open source code behind the @‎wavi app
